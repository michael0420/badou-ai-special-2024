# Week 3 Homework Programs

This repository contains implementations for three programs as part of the third week's homework assignment.

## Programs Included:

1. **Bilinear Interpolation Implementation**
   - This program implements bilinear interpolation, a technique used for interpolating values in a grid based on surrounding points. It's commonly used in image processing for tasks like image resizing.
   - [Add brief description of the implementation and how to use it.]

2. **Histogram Equalization Implementation**
   - This program implements histogram equalization, a method used to enhance the contrast of an image by redistributing pixel intensities. It's useful for improving the visibility of details in images.
   - [Add brief description of the implementation and how to use it.]

3. **Sobel Edge Detection Implementation**
   - This program implements Sobel edge detection, a technique used to detect edges in an image by computing the gradient magnitude. It's widely used in computer vision for tasks like object detection and segmentation.
   - [Add brief description of the implementation and how to use it.]

## Usage

[Provide instructions on how to use each program, including any dependencies, installation steps, and examples.]
